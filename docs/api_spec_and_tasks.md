      responses:

  /transaction:
    post:
      summary: Send bitcoin

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. Initializes Flask app and routes."),
    ("wallet.py", "Contains the Wallet class. Responsible for creating new wallets and getting the balance."),
    ("transaction.py", "Contains the Transaction class. Responsible for sending bitcoin and getting the transaction history."),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class. Responsible for interacting with the SQLite database.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "database.py",
    "wallet.py",
    "transaction.py",
    "main.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'wallet.py' contains the Wallet class which has two methods: 'create_wallet' and 'get_balance'. 
'transaction.py' contains the Transaction class which has two methods: 'send_bitcoin' and 'get_transaction_history'.
'database.py' contains the Database class which is responsible for all database operations.
'main.py' is the entry point of the application. It initializes the Flask app and routes.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The implementation details such as how to interact with the Bitcoin network and how to secure the wallet will depend on the specific libraries and tools used. We need to research on the best practices for securing the wallet and interacting with the Bitcoin network.
